CubeRD
======

Summary
-------
Library that mixes together the Rainbowduino Rainbow Cube library from Seeedstudio
and Cube4 from Freetronics.

The intent is the extend the Rainbowduino Library from Seeedstudio to include the
library calls that Cube4 provides. This will make it possible to run the examples
from either library.

Rainbowduino is a Arduino compatible HW platform that provides capability to drive
8x8 or 4x4x4 RGB LEDs. It is very similar to the Freetronics cube platform with the
major differences being the order in which the LEDs are driven. Both use [TODO].
